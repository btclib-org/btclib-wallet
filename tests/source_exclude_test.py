"""A test that reads `.github` or `fuzz/` off the tree is not in the sdist.

Neither directory is in the sdist, so a test module that loads a path
under one of them fails when it is run from an unpacked sdist.
`[tool.uv.build-backend] source-exclude` in pyproject.toml is where such
a module is named, so that the sdist does not ship it. What no comment
there can show is that the list still names every module of that shape,
and a module added without its entry fails nothing else: check-sdist
compares the sdist with the tracked files and never asks whether a
shipped test can run.

The list is read with `tomllib`, so a comment in the array quoting a
path is never taken for an entry.
