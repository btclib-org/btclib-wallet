# Repository instructions

Follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for issues, pull requests,
local gates, and worktree commands. Use the
[organization's standard][org-standard] for the rules this tree's files
cite, and [REPOSITORY.md](./REPOSITORY.md) before changing workflows
or settings.
See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting.

Keep the primary checkout clean and on `main`; use a separate worktree
for each task, following the setup and cleanup commands in
`CONTRIBUTING.md`.

Choose the least capable model that can reliably complete the task: use
a fast model for straightforward execution, a reasoning-focused model
for multi-step work, and the most capable available model for difficult
or ambiguous problems. Increase capability if progress stalls.

Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) before changing
`src/btclib_wallet/`; it describes the module boundaries and process
interfaces.

## Code Review Rules

Review against [REVIEWING.md](./REVIEWING.md). Its *The verdict* says
which review opens with a verdict line and what every other review
posts.

The heading is the one Codex's GitHub review asks for
([Customize what Codex reviews](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/third-party/github#customize-what-codex-reviews)).
